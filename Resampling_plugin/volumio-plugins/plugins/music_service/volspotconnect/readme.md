#	VOLUMIO SPOTIFY CONNECT PLUGIN

## IMPORTANT

- Requires a Premium or Family account


## IMPORTANT 2

- Now the plugin works with armv6 RPI (previvous to RPI 2) even if just tested on RPI B...And of course with armv7 device (RPI 2, RPI3, Sparky ) 

- Version for armV6 requires a chroot system (11Mo). Installation may be long...10min! Be patient !	

This plugin is designed to use Spotify connect web with volumio
Base on this work : https://github.com/Fornoth/spotify-connect-web
With the great work of ashthespy for the webUI integration!
Thank you to all developpers !

But from a external device and the offcial Spotify app, you'll be able to send your music to your device.

- This version supports Family account : every member can use the device !

## To install
Before intalling the dev version, REMOVE, if exists, the plugin from your system using the webUI plugins page.

Due to a [Volumio decision](https://volumio.org/forum/require-plugins-uploaded-plugins-repo-t8116-10.html), now third party or dev plugin can only be install through SSH. Here is how:

### 1. Enable SSH and connect to Volumio

For security reasons, SSH is disabled by default on all versions after 2.199 (except first boot). It can be however enabled very easily.

Navigate to the DEV ui by pointing your browser to http://VOLUMIOIP/DEV or http://volumio.local/DEV . Find the SSH section, and click enable. From now on your SSH will be permanently enabled.

Now you can connect to Volumio with username `volumio` and password `volumio`.

```
ssh volumio@volumio.local (if you changed the name of your device, replace the second volumio by it or use its IP address.
```

### 2. Download and install the plugin

Type the following commands to download and install plugin:

```
wget https://github.com/balbuze/volumio-plugins/raw/master/plugins/music_service/volspotconnect/volspotconnect.zip
mkdir ./volspotconnect
miniunzip volspotconnect.zip -d ./volspotconnect
cd ./volspotconnect2
volumio plugin install
```
