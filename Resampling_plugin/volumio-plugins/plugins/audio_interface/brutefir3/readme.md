#	DRC- Digital Room Correction for Volumio (previously Brutefir3)

This plugin is designed to use [brutefir](https://www.ludd.ltu.se/~torger/brutefir.html) with volumio2

It provides :

- A automated installation

- A automatic configuration - Just install and enable the plugin. It's ready for use !

- Hardware capabilities detection for output format using [Alsa-capabilities](https://lacocina.nl/permalink-https-lacocina-nl-detect-alsa-output-capabilities)

- The use of custom filters - for DRC digital room correction created with RePhase

- Filters (left and right) can be selected in webUI.

- A room settings : add a delay on speakers if distance from listener is not equal left/right to keep a good stereo image.

## NEW!

The plugin provide an exclusive feature we called __VoBAF__ : Volume Based Adaptativ Filtering ! Different filters may be applied depending on volume level. 

- Place all filters in the required VoBAFfilters shared directory. Up to 7 filters may be used. ( Low, LM1, LM2, LM3, M, HM, High )

- In webUI select first filter and enable VoBAF. Save, it's done!

- Now, when volume is changed, the plugin switches from a filter to an other smmothly!


The plugin is also able to auto generate filter in few clicks, just using a impluse from REW. To do that, it uses [DRC](http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/). It will be documented soon!


To have a idea of what it is, have look here [brutefir plugin wiki](https://volumio.github.io/docs/Plugins_User_Manuals/brutefir/Drc_with_Volumio.html)
